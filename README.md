## üìÉ Description

The Reddit Video Player Chrome Extension is a lightweight extension that replaces the default video player on Reddit with the browser's default video player. Its purpose is to provide a more reliable and stable video playing experience on Reddit by bypassing the custom Reddit video player which is known to have several bugs and performance issues.

This extension is easy to use, requiring no additional configuration or user interaction. Once installed, the extension automatically replaces the custom Reddit video player with the browser's default video player whenever a video is played on Reddit. Additionally, the extension allows users to control the default video quality of the player.

## üöÄ Motivation

- To solve the problems generated by the custom Reddit player, such as performance issues, bugs, and limited video quality control.

- To provide a better video experience for Reddit users who prefer to use the browser's default video player.

## ‚öô How it Works

The Reddit Video Player Chrome Extension works by detecting when a video is being played on Reddit and replacing the default Reddit video player with the browser's default video player. This allows for a smoother and more stable video playback experience. Additionally, users can control the default video quality of the player, providing them with more control over their viewing experience.
